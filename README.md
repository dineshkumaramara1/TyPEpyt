The test directory has the intermediate tests for setting up the MeArm system. 

Start with the MeArm_Calibration for Arduino. That is for both direct servo control and inverse kinetmatics (see its README.md). 

Similar code for the MeArm on the Jetson is in python with MeArm_Cal_Jetson being the direct servo control and MeArm_IK_Jetson having the inverse kinematic code.
